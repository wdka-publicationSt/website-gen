#Hello from ./publications/bar.md


It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease.

Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
a letter:--

>      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
>      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
>      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
>      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
>      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
>      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
> 
> "Your friend,
> 
> "DRACULA."
